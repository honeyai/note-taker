## Project Objective
Note Taker is a simple way to create and delete quick notes. See all the notes you've taken and add new ones. Once you're done you can delete them!


## Technologies 
```
javascript, express.js
```

## Installation
Ensure you have node and npm. After closing the repo run ```npm i``` then ```nodemon server.js```. In your console you should see logged "listening". Head over to localhost:3000/ and the app should be up and running.


## Usage 
After running the installation instructions you can begin to add notes by filling out the Note Title and Note Text fields. Once your note is down, clicking the save icon will have it appear on the sidebar to the left of the fields. To delete notes, click on the trash icon and the note will be trashed!

Alternatively you can visit the [Note Taker](https://quiet-scrubland-31102.herokuapp.com/) for a fully deployed app.
